Vik's Budget Tracker

## Description

Keeping track of personal finances is important - it is extra important for a person who travels often. Their need to track withdrawals and deposits while on the go is essential, hence the reason for the creation of this full-stack web application.

The app runs entirely in the browser, can be accessed from anywhere, and was created utilizing JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. It includes the following features:

- The user is able to use the site with or without an internet connection
- Once the user enters an expense or deposit, they will receive a notification that they have done so
- If the user is offline, once their internet connection is reestablished, then the transactions added while they were offline are added to their history and their totals are updated
