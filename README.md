# Vik's Budget Tracker

## Description

Keeping track of personal fiances is important - it is extra important for a person who travels often. Their need to track withdrawals and deposits are critically important while on the go, hence the reason for this the creation of this full-stack web app.

The app runs entirely in the browser, and was created utilizing JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. It includes the following features:

- The user is able to use the site with or without an internet connection
- Once the user enters an expense or deposit, they will recieve a notification that they have done so
- If the user is offline, once their internet connection is restablished, then the deposits or expenses added while they were offline are added to their transaction history and their totals are updated
